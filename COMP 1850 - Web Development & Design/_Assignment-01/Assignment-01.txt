Questions: 

01: List three BLOCK tags you used, indicating they are block tags.

*	For the structure of the website <header>, <nav>. <main>, and <footer>.  Within the content there are several <p> elements, <table> elements, <h1> and <img> elements


02: List three INLINE tags you used, indicating they are inline tags.

* The one I used most extensively is <em>. I also used <strong> in two spots to highlight two items distinctly from the items in <em> tags.  I also used several <a> tags to make links.


Semantics question: are tags like <tr> and <td> considered inline elements of <table> or part of the larger block?  See also <li> within <ol> or <ul>.

Thanks, 

Matthew
